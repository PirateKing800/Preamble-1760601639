# Indian Preamble Web App

This is a minimal static web app that displays the Preamble of the Indian Constitution. The main components include:

- `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the structure of the webpage.
- `style.css`: A CSS file for basic styling (optional). 
- `script.js`: An optional JavaScript file that can be used for additional functionality.
- The page contains a <p1> tag styled in navy blue where the Preamble is published.

## How to Run

Simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser to view the app.
